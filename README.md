# DIY TESLA HOMELINK LIKE GARAGE DOOR OPENER

This project aims to create an standalone garage door opener. To do that, you will need an ESP32, a CC1101 for garage door signal transmission and a GPS module (like Neo-6M, Neo-7M or Neo-8M, although others will work). 

# Background

I use to own a Legacy Tesla Model 3 from 2019, and that car was sold with integrated Homelink. It was one of the things I liked more about the car. Now that I have changed my car, that is something I miss. Also, as the time of this guide, now Tesla sells it as a 355 â‚¬ accessory. Sorry, but that is a lot of money for a remote control. Time for DIYing.
